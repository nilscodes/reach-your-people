# Reach your People - Core Publishing Service

## Overview
The publishing service allows verified publishers to send announcements. The service will check publishing permissions for the submitting entity. After successful validation, it will access the subscription service to determine eligible recipients and message types to distribute and provide them to a queue for further processing.

Please note that this project is currently in its early stages, and the structure and features are subject to change based on the complexity and requirements of different verification types.
