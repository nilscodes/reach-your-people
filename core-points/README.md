# Reach your People - Core Points Service

## Overview
The points service is a reward tracking system that allows us to incentivize activities and track achievements for users of RYP. Since we do not want it part of the core requirements of running RYP, we decided to make it a separate service. This also allows the service to become unavailable and for users to still leverage RYP.
