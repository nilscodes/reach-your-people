# Reach your People - Core Verification Service

## Overview
The verification services allows publishers and subscribers to verify their project or wallet ownership. Depending on the type, different verification mechanisms will be supported. It is possible that multiple verification services will be developed instead of just one. This will be to be determined when the complexity of the different verifications (wallet vs. SPO vs DIDs) has been evaluated. The verification service will delegate some persistence storage to the subscription service (for example a verified wallet can be linked to one or more social account).

Please note that this project is currently in its early stages, and the structure and features are subject to change based on the complexity and requirements of different verification types.
