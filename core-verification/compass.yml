  The verification services allows publishers and subscribers to verify their project or wallet ownership. Depending on the type, different
  verification mechanisms will be supported. It is possible that multiple verification services will be developed instead of just one. This will be to
  be determined when the complexity of the different verifications (wallet vs. SPO vs DIDs) has been evaluated. The verification service will delegate
  some persistence storage to the subscription service (for example a verified wallet can be linked to one or more social account).
