# Reach your People (RYP)

## Name
The working title of this project is "Reach Your People". We will refer to it as RYP or "Reach Your People" in the documentation.

## Description
TBD (Milestone 2)

## Use Case
*Imagine Alice and Bob are holders of a governance token for the $NICE DAO. Jeff is a community lead in the DAO. Alice and Bob are busy people, and Alice only has access to email on the go most of the week, while Bob has Discord, but never checks his notifications, since there are so many. He is fairly active on Twitter, though. Jeff is publishing a summary for the newest vote on how to use the treasury in 2024. He presses send, and an email pops up in Alice's inbox. A notification about a Twitter DM with the same content and a link to the proposal appears on Bob's phone, seconds later. The twist: Jeff does not know Alice or Bob. Nor does he know their wallet addresses, email address or Twitter handle. He does not need to, since his DAO uses "Reach Your People".*
