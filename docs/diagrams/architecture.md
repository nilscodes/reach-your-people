# Basic Architecture Diagram

## üí° Purpose

This article outlines the initial architectural design of the "Reach Your People" (RYP) application. It will be adjusted as the architecture evolves and as we find functional and non-functional requirements and create ADRs for the specifics of each service.

## üìì Glossary

### Core Service
A crucial service built by our team to support the RYP application. Without it, the application cannot function.

### Infrastructure Service
Services built to support the infrastructure of the RYP application, that have not been created by the team. This includes databases, queueing solutions, message brokers, pre-built Cardano indexers etc.

### Optional Service
Optional services are not required for RYP to function, but can improve the user experience or increase the messaging reach of the application.

### User
The end user/client accessing the application. This includes both publishers and subscribers. Different user interfaces will lead to different interactions with the underlying services.

### Ingress
A cluster ingress that ensure the requests coming from the outside world are routed correctly to the respective services. In the initial design, all incoming user-driven traffic will go through HTTP/HTTPS.

### Subscription Service
The subscription service tracks which users/wallets have subscribed (or explicitly unsubscribed) from which message types, projects etc. It allows the publishing service to access this information when something is announced, and the end user to change their subscription preferences.

### Verification Service
The verification services allows publishers and subscribers to verify their project or wallet ownership. Depending on the type, different verification mechanisms will be supported. It is possible that multiple verification services will be developed instead of just one. This will be to be determined when the complexity of the different verifications (wallet vs. SPO vs DIDs) has been evaluated. The verification service will delegate some persistence storage to the subscription service (for example a verified wallet can be linked to one or more social account).

### Publishing Service
The publishing service allows verified publishers to send announcements. The service will check publishing permissions for the submitting entity. After successful validation, it will access the subscription service to determine eligible recipients and message types to distribute and provide them to a queue for further processing.

### URL Shortener
While theoretically optional, we have opted to make a shortener part of the core services, to ensure we have full control over the URLs provided. This also allows us to block traffic to URLs that are later identified as spam or scam, but also track the reach of announcements. During publishing, links in announcements and other links will be shortened. When visited, the URL shortener will expand the link accordingly.

### Chain Indexer (verification)
A chain indexing solution for Cardano that is suitable for accessing the information required to verify wallets, DIDs etc. Multiple indexers may be required, depending on the implementation.

### Chain Indexer (publishing)
The standard publishing approach will be through a web interface and APIs. However, it is technically possible to also allow publishing through on-chain metadata. If this additional submission mechanism is implemented, an optional chain indexing solution for Cardano is needed. It would ingest the publishing transactions that then can be automatically verified and the associated announcement can be processed by RYP.

### SQL Database
A relational database solution that stores the subscription preferences and maps wallets of subscribers to their verified social media and messaging accounts. In the future, some or all of that information can be stored on-chain and make the solution more decentralized. For this however to safely happen, a privacy-preserving blockchain needs to be available or encryption-mechanisms used, which is out of scope of the initial prototype.

### Document Database
A document database that stores the published announcements, which are natively built as JSON objects following the Activity Streams 2.0 standard. This means a document database that can natively store these without having to have to predefine a schema is better suited. It is also easier to store custom analytics data alongside the announcements.

### Queue
Any queuing solution that allows persistent storage of messages that should be processed can be used. There are no strict requirements for ordering or performance at this time.

### Key-value store
A key-value store (like Redis) is being used by various services as a temporary message store (for message content that is too big for the queuing solution for example). It is also used as a cache for performance improvements where sensible.

### Publishing Integration #n
The publishing integrations are the different systems that will be built to bring the published messages to the end users. They read messages from the publishing queue and are solely responsible for the delivery. When messages reach the integration, all decisions with regards to eligibility and verification should have been made, and only integration-related issues should prevent the delivery (for example rejecting direct messages from the corresponding Discord bot or blocked email addresses).

### Cardano, Discord, Twilio, etc...
These external systems already exist and are connected to as read, read-write or write-only systems, depending on the associated service/integration.

## üìù Notes

### Service Discovery
We will investigate if a service-discovery based solution can make creating new integrations even more decoupled from the core services. With the initial proposal, core services have to know about all existing integrations to properly give them access to the correct data. A service discovery solution would notably change the architecture diagram and will be further evaluated during the lifecycle of the development. In this case, new integrations would register with a service registry. This solution would mean some of the app-specific verification, subscription and publishing capabilities code would live in the integration, instead of just the core modules.
